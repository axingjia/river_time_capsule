					<h3>Lyrics</h3>
					<div style="white-space: pre;">
Salvation sounds a new beginning
As distant hearts begin believing
Redemption's bid is unrelenting
Your love goes on
Your love goes on
You carry us, carry us
When the world gives way
You cover us, cover us
With Your endless grace
Your love is relentless
Your love is relentless
Your love is relentless
Your love is relentless
The time is up for chasing shadows
You gave the world a light to follow
A hope that shines beyond tomorrow
Your love goes on
Your love goes on
You carry us, carry us
When the world gives way
You cover us, cover us
With Your endless grace
Your love is relentless
Your love is relentless
Your love is relentless
Your love is relentless
Tearing through the veil of darkness
Breaking every chain, You set us free
Fighting for the furthest heart You gave
Your own life for all to see
Tearing through the veil of darkness
Breaking every chain, You set us free
Fighting for the furthest heart You gave
Your life (Your love is relentless)
You carry us, carry us (Your love is relentless)
You cover us, cover us (Your love is relentless)
You carry us, carry us (Your love is relentless)
You cover us, cover us (Your love is relentless)
You carry us, carry us (Your love is relentless)
You cover us, cover us (Your love is relentless)
You carry us, carry us (Your love is relentless)
You cover us, cover us (Your love is relentless)
Your love is relentless
Your love is relentless
Your love is relentless
Your love is relentless
Songwriters: Joel Houston / Matt Crocker
